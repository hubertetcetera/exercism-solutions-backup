# Exercism Rust Solutions

A collection of solutions for the [Exercism Rust Track](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust).

The goal is to provide clean, idiomatic Rust implementations that can help
learn core concepts such as ownership, borrowing, iterators, pattern matching,
and error handling.

## Repository Layout

Each exercise lives in its own folder:

```
solutions/
└── rust
  ├── clock/
  ├── gigasecond/
  ├── reverse-string/
  └── …
```

## How to Use
- Browse the exercises to see idiomatic Rust approaches to common programming problems.
- Compare multiple ways of solving the same exercise.
- Use this repo as a reference while working through the track yourself.
